## Quizzical

This is a project is from the final solo project in Bob Ziroll's Intro to React course on Scrimba.com. While I made some design tweaks and added additional functionality to the original design, ultimately the concept for this app is not my own and from that course. However, I wrote 99% of the code for this. Anyone looking to learn React should seriously consider Bob's course, which was free and easy to follow.

Special thanks to the Scrimba Community for their support, and especially: Vi, Mark, and Ben W. for thier troubleshooting help.
